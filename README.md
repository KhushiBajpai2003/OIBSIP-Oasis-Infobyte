**TASK 1 - CAR PRICE PREDICTION MODEL**

**Introduction**

This repository contains the code for training a machine learning model to predict selling price of the car based on some features. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the seeling price of the car based on their features.

**Dependencies**

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

NumPy
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Model Training
The code for training the classification model can be found in the Car Price Predictor.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
Logistic Regression 
model is trained using the car dataset and evaluated for its accuracy
Testing
After training the models, a new test dataset is used to assess their performance. The test dataset contains different entries for features and it predicted thr accurate price for those cars. The trained models predict the species of these flowers, and their accuracy is evaluated.

**TASK 2 - UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON**

**Introduction**

This repository contains a data science project aimed at analyzing the unemployment rate, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. Unemployment is an important economic indicator that measures the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labor force. By studying and understanding the trends and factors affecting unemployment, we can gain valuable insights into the job market and the broader economy.

**Project Overview**

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the unemployment rate during the Covid-19 pandemic. The project will involve collecting relevant data, cleaning and preprocessing the data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA)

**Requirements**

To run the notebooks and reproduce the analysis, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn,etc.)

**TASK -3 Iris Flower Classification**

This repository contains the code for training a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers based on their measurements. The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, each having distinct measurement characteristics. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify Iris flowers based on their measurements.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris flower dataset, which is commonly used for classification tasks. It includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 Iris flowers, with 50 samples for each species. The dataset is available in the repository as iris.csv.

**Dependencies**

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

NumPy
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Model Training
The code for training the classification models can be found in the iris_classification.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. Three different models are trained:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Each model is trained using the Iris flower dataset and evaluated for its accuracy
Testing
After training the models, a new test dataset is used to assess their performance. The test dataset contains measurements of Iris flowers with unknown species. The trained models predict the species of these flowers, and their accuracy is evaluated.

**TASK -4 Sales Analysis Using Python**

**Introduction**

This repository contains a data science project aimed at the Sales Analysis.Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.

**Project Overview**

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the sales rate for the products. The project will involve collecting relevant data, cleaning and preprocessing the data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA)

**Requirements**

To run the notebooks and reproduce the analysis, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn,etc.)
